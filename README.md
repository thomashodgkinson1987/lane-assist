Lane Assist is a physics-based vehicle steering assistance system that automatically helps keep your vehicle driving straight along roads at precise angles. This mod uses physics calculations to apply gentle corrective forces, aiming for smooth and realistic vehicle control without interfering with the game's physics engine.

Key Features:
- ✅ **No Debug Mode Required** - Works in normal game mode
